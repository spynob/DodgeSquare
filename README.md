# game
This is a small project that was conducted during the christmas break of 2021. 
The project was heavily inspired from a youtube series in order to learn the basics of making a game. It is still a work in progress, but I my free time was obviously reduced
during the semester and I plan on returning to it this summer.

The game consists in a little cube controlled by a player that has to dodge various enemy types (the little cubes)
  red: normal enemy
  blue: fast enemy
  green: "hunter" enemy

There is a life bar that decreases with collisions
I plan to implement a menu and different windows and more levels

How to play:
  awsd - keys to move left, up, down or right
  c - change color, because why not
  dogde the enemies :)
